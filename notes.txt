There seems to be some form of state machine or scheduler?
Looks like there is a task set. The task keeps being iterated through until a message is completely processed and passed off to another process.

Operation Flow
1 - Resets watchdog
2 - Disconnectes then reconnects usb ~250ms?
3 - Sets output Ports
4 - Sets operation mode from eeprom?

LED uint8_t array of max led size
[0:2]   = PWM value for each of the three channels ~ 0-256
[1]     - Red channel
[0]     - Blue channel
[2]     - Green Channel


Reports - GET 0x01
ID  -   
1   -   LED MODE (for each channel)
2   -   Info Block 1
3   -   Info Block 2
4   -   LED MODE 
5   -   LED Data from Index
6-9 -   Serial stream of device data

Writes - SET 0x09
ID  -
1   - Set output colour in PWM mode, write 1st pixel in WS2812 Mode
2   - Write Data to EEPROM? Related to 3 somehow
3   - Write Data to EEPROM? Related to 2 somehow? Maybe one is a start and the other is continue? or second data frame?
4   - Set device mode
5   - Write new color value to a specific WS2812 pixel on a specific channel
6-9 - 

EEPROM Map
[13]    - Mode Value


Changes:
*   added Get ID 10 - Return button state
*   Modified Serial number from BSXXXXXX-1.0 format with a size of 12 bytes. To TVxxxxxxxxxxxxY-1.0 with a size of 19
